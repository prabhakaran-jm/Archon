# AWS Well-Architected Framework - Security Pillar

## Overview
The Security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what with privilege management, protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.

## Design Principles
- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Apply security at all layers
- Enable traceability
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

## Security Best Practices

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Use least privilege access
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- Use AWS Organizations for multi-account management

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL
- Implement proper key management
- Use AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificates
- Enable S3 server-side encryption
- Use EBS encryption for volumes

### Infrastructure Protection
- Use VPCs to isolate resources
- Implement security groups with least privilege
- Use Network ACLs for additional layer of security
- Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Use AWS WAF for web application protection
- Implement DDoS protection with AWS Shield

### Detective Controls
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for API logging
- Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring
- Implement AWS Config for compliance
- Use Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection
- Enable AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings
- Use Amazon Inspector for vulnerability assessment

## Common Security Issues in IaC

### S3 Bucket Security
- **Issue**: Public read access on S3 buckets
- **Fix**: Enable block public access settings
- **Evidence**: CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark 3.6

### Security Group Rules
- **Issue**: Overly permissive security group rules (0.0.0.0/0)
- **Fix**: Restrict CIDR blocks to specific IP ranges
- **Evidence**: CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark 4.1

### Encryption
- **Issue**: Unencrypted EBS volumes
- **Fix**: Enable encryption by default
- **Evidence**: NIST SP 800-53 SC-28

### Access Keys
- **Issue**: Hardcoded access keys in code
- **Fix**: Use IAM roles and AWS Secrets Manager
- **Evidence**: AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar
