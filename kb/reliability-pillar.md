# AWS Well-Architected Framework - Reliability Pillar

## Overview
The Reliability pillar focuses on the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

## Design Principles
- Test recovery procedures
- Automatically recover from failure
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

## Reliability Best Practices

### Foundations
- Use multiple Availability Zones
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Use AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Use AWS Config for compliance monitoring

### Change Management
- Use blue/green deployments
- Implement canary deployments
- Use AWS CodeDeploy for automated deployments
- Implement proper rollback procedures
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Failure Management
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement proper error handling
- Use dead letter queues for failed messages
- Implement graceful degradation

### Monitoring and Observability
- Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring
- Implement custom metrics and dashboards
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Implement proper logging strategies
- Use AWS CloudTrail for audit logging

## Common Reliability Issues in IaC

### Single Point of Failure
- **Issue**: Resources deployed in single AZ
- **Fix**: Use multiple Availability Zones
- **Evidence**: AWS Well-Architected Framework Reliability Pillar

### No Backup Strategy
- **Issue**: No backup or disaster recovery plan
- **Fix**: Implement automated backups and cross-region replication
- **Evidence**: SOC 2 Type II CC7.1

### Insufficient Monitoring
- **Issue**: No monitoring or alerting
- **Fix**: Implement comprehensive monitoring with CloudWatch
- **Evidence**: AWS Well-Architected Framework Reliability Pillar

### No Auto Scaling
- **Issue**: Fixed capacity that can't handle load spikes
- **Fix**: Implement Auto Scaling groups
- **Evidence**: AWS Well-Architected Framework Reliability Pillar

## Reliability Patterns

### Multi-AZ Deployment
- Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones
- Use RDS Multi-AZ for database redundancy
- Use Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Implement cross-AZ replication

### Auto Scaling
- Use EC2 Auto Scaling for compute resources
- Implement Application Auto Scaling for other services
- Use predictive scaling for known patterns
- Implement proper scaling policies

### Backup and Recovery
- Implement automated backups
- Use cross-region replication
- Test recovery procedures regularly
- Implement point-in-time recovery
- Use AWS Backup for centralized backup management

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Use AWS Lambda for serverless circuit breakers
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms
- Monitor circuit breaker states

## Disaster Recovery
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Target time for system recovery
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Backup Strategies**: Full, incremental, differential backups
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented and tested procedures
- **Cross-Region Replication**: For critical data and applications

## Monitoring and Alerting
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: System and application metrics
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Automated alerting
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized logging
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing
- **Custom Dashboards**: Business and technical metrics

## Compliance References
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service organization controls for availability
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management systems
- **NIST SP 800-53**: Security controls for federal information systems
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework**: Reliability pillar guidance
