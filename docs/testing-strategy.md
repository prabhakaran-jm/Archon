# Archon Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for Archon across all development phases, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

## Phase 1: MVP Fast Pass ✅ COMPLETED

### Unit Tests (7/7 passing)
- **Webhook Handler**: Signature verification, payload parsing, event filtering
- **fetch_pr_context**: GitHub API integration, PR metadata extraction
- **security_static_scan**: Checkov/tfsec execution, SARIF generation
- **finops_pricing_delta**: Cost calculation, confidence intervals
- **post_pr_comment**: GitHub comment creation/updates

### Test Coverage
- All core tools have unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Webhook signature verification tested
- Tool I/O JSON contracts validated
- Error handling scenarios covered

## Phase 2: Deep Pass

### Planned Unit Tests
- **run_iac_plan**: ECS task orchestration, plan parsing
- **kb_lookup**: Knowledge base retrieval, evidence formatting
- **Enhanced finops_pricing_delta**: Plan-based cost analysis
- **ECS Integration**: Task lifecycle management

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end deep scan workflow
- ECS Fargate task execution
- Plan artifact storage and retrieval
- Knowledge base citation integration

### Test Infrastructure
- Mock ECS client for task management
- Sample Terraform/CDK plans for testing
- Knowledge base content fixtures
- Performance benchmarks for plan execution

## Phase 3: Auto-Fix

### Planned Unit Tests
- **create_remediation_pr**: PR creation, diff generation
- **Auto-fix logic**: S3 SSE, lifecycle rules, gp2→gp3
- **Evidence integration**: Well-Architected Framework citations
- **PR validation**: Minimal diffs, proper references

### Integration Tests
- Complete auto-fix workflow
- GitHub PR creation and validation
- Evidence-based remediation
- Multi-file patch generation

## Phase 4: Infrastructure & Deployment

### Infrastructure Tests
- Terraform/CDK deployment validation
- AWS resource creation and configuration
- GitHub App setup and permissions
- Secrets management integration

### End-to-End Tests
- Real GitHub repository integration
- Production webhook processing
- Complete analysis pipeline
- Performance and reliability testing

## Testing Framework

### Tools
- **pytest**: Test framework and execution
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **moto**: AWS service mocking
- **responses**: HTTP request mocking

```

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Pre-commit hooks for test execution
- Coverage reporting and thresholds
- Performance regression detection

## Quality Gates

### Phase Completion Criteria
1. **All unit tests passing** (100% for core tools)
2. **Integration tests passing** for end-to-end workflows
3. **Coverage threshold met** (minimum 80% for tools)
4. **Performance benchmarks** within acceptable limits
5. **Security tests passing** (no credential leakage, proper validation)

### Test Maintenance
- Tests updated with each feature addition
- Mock data refreshed regularly
- Performance baselines updated
- Documentation kept current

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Testing
- **Chaos Engineering**: Failure scenario testing
- **Load Testing**: High-volume PR processing
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing for webhooks
- **Compliance Testing**: SOC2, GDPR validation

### Monitoring & Observability
- Test execution metrics
- Coverage trend analysis
- Performance regression alerts
- Test failure root cause analysis
