# Archon

**Autonomous Principal Architect for CI/CD**

Archon prevents costly and insecure infrastructure-as-code (IaC) changes before merge by running autonomous FinOps, Security, and Well-Architected checks on pull requests, posting unified guidance, and (optionally) opening small auto-fix PRs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy Archon
make deploy

# Run local development
make dev

# Run tests
make test
```

## Features

- 🛡️ **Security Scanning**: Static analysis with Checkov/tfsec for AWS best practices
- 💰 **Cost Analysis**: Real-time pricing deltas with confidence intervals
- ⚙️ **Reliability Checks**: Well-Architected Framework compliance
- 🤖 **Auto-Fix PRs**: Automated remediation for common issues
- 📊 **Observability**: CloudWatch metrics and detailed reporting

## Architecture

See [docs/architecture-diagram.md](docs/architecture-diagram.md) for detailed system architecture.

## Development

### Phase 1: MVP Fast Pass ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Repository structure and documentation
2. ✅ Webhook endpoint with GitHub signature verification
3. ✅ Bedrock AgentCore with tool registry
4. ✅ Core tool stubs with strict I/O JSON contracts
5. ✅ Local testing and validation framework
6. ✅ Fast pass analysis (< 60s) - *All tools working*
7. ✅ Basic FinOps pricing calculator - *Heuristic cost analysis*
8. ✅ Security static scanning - *Checkov/tfsec with SARIF*
9. ✅ Unified PR comments - *Markdown with 💰🛡️⚙️ sections*

### Phase 2: Deep Pass ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ ECS Fargate integration for Terraform/CDK plan execution
- ✅ Enhanced cost analysis with real plan JSON parsing
- ✅ Knowledge Base integration with Well-Architected Framework
- ✅ Deep-scan label trigger for full analysis
- ✅ Phase 2 unit tests and validation framework

### Phase 3: Auto-Fix ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Automated remediation PRs with evidence-based references
- ✅ S3 security fixes: encryption, block public access, lifecycle rules
- ✅ Cost optimizations: gp2→gp3, VPC endpoints for NAT Gateway savings
- ✅ Security group CIDR restrictions and compliance fixes
- ✅ Comprehensive auto-fix generators with Terraform/CDK templates
- ✅ Phase 3 unit tests: 5/5 passing

**🎉 All Three Phases Complete! Archon is ready for production deployment.**

### Development History

Archon was developed in three phases with incremental capabilities:

1. **Phase 1: MVP Fast Pass** - Fast pass analysis with basic tools
2. **Phase 2: Deep Pass** - ECS Fargate integration for full IaC analysis  
3. **Phase 3: Auto-Fix** - Automated remediation PR generation

All phases are now merged into `main` and ready for production deployment.

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow clean development practices with comprehensive testing
2. Make small, vertical commits with clear messages
3. Each commit must compile, run, and include tests
4. Prefer interfaces first, then stubs, then implementation
5. Test locally before pushing to remote branches
6. **Unit tests required for every phase** - All tools must have comprehensive test coverage

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: `tests/` directory with pytest framework
- **Phase 1 (MVP Fast Pass)**: ✅ 7/7 unit tests passing
- **Phase 2 (Deep Pass)**: ✅ 8/8 unit tests passing (ECS, pricing, WAF)
- **Phase 3 (Auto-Fix)**: ✅ 5/5 unit tests passing (PR generation, fix generators)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end webhook → tool → comment flow
